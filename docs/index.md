# hitachi Provider



## Example Usage

```terraform
/*
** Terraform Configuration for Hitachi Provider and VSS Block / SAN Storage System / hitachi_infrastructure_gateway_provider
**
** This Terraform configuration defines the required provider blocks for interacting with Hitachi
** resources, specifically for VSS block and SAN storage system.
**
** The "required_providers" block specifies the version and source of the Hitachi provider to be used.
** You can customize the version and source accordingly.
**
** The "provider" block configures the Hitachi provider with necessary authentication details for the
** VSS block and SAN storage system.
** Customize the values of "vss_block_address", "management_ip", "username", and "password" to match your
** environment's configuration.
