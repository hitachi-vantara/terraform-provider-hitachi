## Example Usage

```terraform
/*
** Terraform Configuration for Hitachi Provider and VOS Block / SAN Storage System
**
** This Terraform configuration defines the required provider blocks for interacting with Hitachi
** resources, specifically for VOS Block and SAN storage system.
**
** The "required_providers" block specifies the version and source of the Hitachi provider to be used.
** You can customize the version and source accordingly.
**
** The "provider" block configures the Hitachi provider with necessary authentication details for the
** VOS Block and SAN storage system.
** Customize the values of "vosb_block_address", "management_ip", "username", and "password" to match your
** environment's configuration.
