# hitachi Provider



## Example Usage

```terraform
#
# VSP Terraform Provider
#
# The Hitachi Terraform provider enables automation and infrastructure-as-code
# management of Hitachi storage systems, including:
#
# - VSP One SDS Block and Cloud (AWS, GCP, Azure)
# - VSP One SDS Block (Baremetal)
# - VSP One Block 20 series
# - VSP One Block High End
# - VSP 5000 series
# - VSP E series
# - VSP F series
# - VSP G series
#
# This provider allows you to retrieve and manage storage configuration such as
# volumes, hostgroups, ports, and replication settings. It supports both software-defined
# and SAN-based storage deployments, giving administrators consistent tooling for provisioning
# and lifecycle operations across different storage types.
#
# The provider supports three connection types:
#
# - `hitachi_vosb_provider`: For VSP One SDS Block and Cloud systems.
# - 'hitachi_vsp_one_provider' : For VSP One Block 20 series, VSP One Block High End, and VSP E series.
# - `san_storage_system`: For VSP One Block 20 series, VSP One Block High End, VSP 5000 series, VSP E series,
#                         VSP F series, and VSP G series.
#
# Example configuration for VSP One SDS Block:
#
# provider "hitachi" {
#   hitachi_vosb_provider {
#     vosb_address = "10.10.12.13"
#     username     = var.hitachi_storage_user
#     password     = var.hitachi_storage_password
#   }
# }
#
# Example configuration for hitachi_vsp_one_provider
#
# terraform {
#   required_providers {
#  hitachi = {
#   version = "2.3.0"
#   source  = "localhost/hitachi-vantara/hitachi"
#    }
#  }
#}
#
# provider "hitachi" {
#   hitachi_vsp_one_provider {
#      serial        = 12345
#      management_ip = "10.10.11.12"                    
#      username      = var.hitachi_storage_user
#      password      = var.hitachi_storage_password
#  }
# }
#
#
#
# Example configuration for SAN storage systems:
#
# provider "hitachi" {
#   san_storage_system {
#     serial        = 12345
#     management_ip = "10.10.11.12"
#     username      = var.hitachi_storage_user
#     password      = var.hitachi_storage_password
#   }
# }
#

terraform {
  required_providers {
    hitachi = {
      version = "2.3.0"
      source  = "localhost/hitachi-vantara/hitachi"
    }
  }
}

provider "hitachi" {
  hitachi_vosb_provider {
    vosb_address = "10.10.12.13"
    username     = var.hitachi_storage_user
    password     = var.hitachi_storage_password
  }
