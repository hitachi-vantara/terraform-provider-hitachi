# hitachi_vsp_hostgroup (Resource)

The following request creates a host group for the port. The host mode and the host mode option can also be specified at the same time when the host group is created.

## Example Usage

```terraform
#
# Hitachi VSP Hostgroup Resource
#
# This section defines a Terraform resource block to create a Hitachi VSP hostgroup.
# The resource "hitachi_vsp_hostgroup" represents a hostgroup on a Hitachi Virtual
# Storage Platform (VSP) and allows you to manage its configuration using Terraform.
#
# Customize the values of the parameters (serial, hostgroup_number, hostgroup_name,
# port_id, host_mode_options, host_mode) and the nested "lun" block to match your
# desired hostgroup configuration.
#
# For detailed information about host_mode_options and host_mode, please refer to
# the official Hitachi documentation:
# https://knowledge.hitachivantara.com/Documents/Management_Software/SVOS/9.8.6/Volume_Management_-_VSP_E_Series/Host_Attachment/14_Host_modes_and_host_mode_options

resource "hitachi_vsp_hostgroup" "myhg" {
  serial           = 12345 
  hostgroup_number = 23
  hostgroup_name   = "TESTING-HOSTGROUP" 
  port_id          = "CL1-A"           
  host_mode_options = [12, 32]
  host_mode         = "AIX"
 
  # SET of LUN
  lun {
    ldev_id = 25
    lun     = 12
  }
