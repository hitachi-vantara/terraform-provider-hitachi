# hitachi_vsp_hostgroup (Resource)

:meta:subcategory:VSP Storage Host Group:The following request creates a host group for the port. The host mode and the host mode option can also be specified at the same time when the host group is created.

## Example Usage

```terraform
#
# Hitachi VSP Hostgroup Resource
#
# This section defines a Terraform resource block to create a Hitachi VSP hostgroup.
# The resource "hitachi_vsp_hostgroup" represents a hostgroup on a Hitachi Virtual
# Storage Platform (VSP) and allows you to manage its configuration using Terraform.
#
# Customize the values of the parameters (serial, hostgroup_number, hostgroup_name,
# port_id, host_mode_options, host_mode) and the nested "lun" block to match your
# desired hostgroup configuration.
#
# For detailed information about host_mode_options and host_mode, please refer to
# the official Hitachi documentation:
# https://knowledge.hitachivantara.com/Documents/Management_Software/SVOS/9.8.6/Volume_Management_-_VSP_E_Series/Host_Attachment/14_Host_modes_and_host_mode_options

  hostgroup_name   = "TESTING-HOSTGROUP" 
  port_id          = "CL1-A"
