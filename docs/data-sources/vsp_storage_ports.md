# hitachi_vsp_storage_ports (Data Source)

The following request obtains information about ports.

## Example Usage

```terraform
#
# Hitachi VSP Storage Ports Data Retrieval
#
# This section defines a data source block to fetch information about a specific
# storage port from a Hitachi Virtual Storage Platform (VSP) using HashiCorp
# Configuration Language (HCL).
#
# The data source block "hitachi_vsp_storage_ports" retrieves details about a
# storage port associated with the provided parameters. This allows you to access
# configuration and property information for the specified storage port.
#
# Customize the values of the parameters (serial, port_id) to match your
# environment, enabling you to retrieve information about the desired storage port.
#

data "hitachi_vsp_storage_ports" "storageports" {
  serial  = 12345
  port_id = "CL4-C"
}

output "storageports" {
  value = data.hitachi_vsp_storage_ports.storageports
}
```
