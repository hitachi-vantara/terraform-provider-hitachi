# hitachi_vsp_hostgroups (Data Source)

VSP Storage Host Group: The following request gets information about host groups of the ports.

## Example Usage

```terraform
#
# Hitachi VSP Hostgroup Data Retrieval
#
# This section defines a data source block and an output block to fetch
# and expose information about a specific hostgroup from a Hitachi Virtual
# Storage Platform (VSP) using HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL).
#
# The data source block "hitachi_vsp_hostgroups" fetches details about hostgroups
# based on the provided parameters. The output block "hostgroups" exports the
# retrieved hostgroup information for later use.
#
# Modify the values of the parameters (serial, port_ids) to suit your environment,
# allowing you to retrieve information about the desired hostgroups.
#

data "hitachi_vsp_hostgroups" "hostgroups" {
  serial   = 12345
  port_ids = ["CL7-C", "CL7-A", "CL8-B", "CL9-C"]
}

output "hostgroups" {
  value = data.hitachi_vsp_hostgroups.hostgroups
}
```
