# hitachi_vosb_storage_pools (Data Source)

VSP One SDS Block Storage Pools: Obtains a list of storage pool information.

## Example Usage

```terraform
#
# Hitachi VSP One SDS Block Storage Pools Data Retrieval
#
# This section defines a data source block to fetch information about specific storage pools
# from a Hitachi VSP One SDS Block using HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL).
#
# The data source block "hitachi_vosb_storage_pools" retrieves details about storage pools
# associated with the provided parameters. This allows you to access configuration and property
# information for the specified storage pools.
#
# Customize the values of the parameters (vosb_address, storage_pool_names) to match your
# environment, enabling you to retrieve information about the desired storage pools.
#

data "hitachi_vosb_storage_pools" "pool" {
  vosb_address       = "10.10.12.13"
  storage_pool_names = ["SP01"]
}

output "pool" {
  value = data.hitachi_vosb_storage_pools.pool
}
```
